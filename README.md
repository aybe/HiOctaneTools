# Hi-Octane Tools
Tools to inspect and modify levels of the game Hi-Octane by Bullfrog (1995).
The reverse-engineering work on all files of the game was done by srtuss (most of it) and movAX13h in winter 2016.

### Editor (unfinished)
The editor can be used to modify existing levels and, when it's finished, to create new ones from scratch. Some modes are not implemented yet. If you have time, please help!
